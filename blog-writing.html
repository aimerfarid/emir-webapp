  <h1>Intermittent Fasting</h1>
  <h3>1. What is Intermiitent Fasting? (IF)</h3>
  <p>Contrary to common belief intermittent fasting is not an actual 'Diet' that implies strict rules and restrictions on what you can and can't eat but it's actually more of a 'Way of Eating' where the only real rules are that you choose to eat
    within a certain timeframe - and the rest of the day you fast</p>
  <h3>2. Why would I want to do it..?</h3>
  <p>
    Based on my personal experience physically & spiritually, there are a ton of benefits that comes along with it - and it spreads a lot further than just fat loss (Caloric Deficit). Fasting in general has excellent physiological benefits:
    <ul>
      <li>Improved insulin levels</li>
      <li>Benefitting Gut Health</li>
      <li>Reduce inflammation</li>
      <li>Decreases oxidative stress</li>
      <li>Tons of more benefits</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Overall, it's benefits for inducing a calorie deficit and allowing for fat loss are quite substantial. However, it won't be for everyone so the best thing to do is just give it a shot for at <strong><em>least a week</em></strong> (and measure to obtain results). This would indicate if this method suits you or not.</p>
  <h3>3. How is it done & Where do I begin?</h3>
  <p>The best place to begin is to look at your current <em>work schedule</em> or if you're in college then your <em>classes schedules</em> and see where you can fit in your fasting period (window). Two methods:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Morning:</strong> If you enjoy your breakfast and a morning person then start to finish your fasting period early meaning to end your last meal around afternoon to evening.</li>
    <li><strong>Dinner (My Method):</strong> If you don't mind skipping or eating your breakfast late then begin your eating schedule around noon time and end it before the night turns completely dark.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ideally: The timeframe to execute IF is using the most common ratio of 16:8 which defines as <em>16 hours of fasting</em> and <em>8 hours of eating</em>. If this is a bit too difficult to start of with, then have the mindset that you're already sleeping 8 hours (College kids will laugh at me for this lol) so it is just adding 4 more hours from both sides of your sleeping schedule (Sleep at 11PM then stop eating at 7PM).</p>
  <h4>How do I do it..?</h4>
  <p>I will start my first meal at 11 or 12, and end my meal (dinner) at 7 or 8.</p>

  <h3>Here is my story...</h3>
  <p>
    A little bit about myself, I have graduated from Vanderbilt University with a Bachelor of Computer Engineering and minor in Engineering Management. As an individual who is interested in continuous professional development, I have dedicated more than 3 years of learning programming and software development throughout my college career in Vanderbilt University.
  </p>
  <p>This is consider one of my proudest project of building my own personal website which consists of three blogs of my own thoughts (personal posts), travel posts either with my family, friends or myself and my workout posts. My workout post consist of programs for all future users or visitors who are interested in learning how to lift and also maintain their body shape through my suggestions.</p>
  <p>I wish to expand this website and hope to inspire not just myself but other future coders or story tellers to be a role model for the newer generations.</p>
  <h5>Have a blast with all my posts!</h5>
